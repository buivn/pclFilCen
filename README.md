Th code summuries some common pre-processing algorithm to deal with the raw point cloud data from RGB-D camera. The order of processes as following: (1) voxelize, (2) passThroughFilter - distance filter, (3) planar filter, (4) segmentation, (5) centroid Identification.\
The point cloud data input as the image below:

,processis to filter and find a centroid of objects set from depth camera data
